# synesthesAI
A neural network framework to visualize sound.
Currently in the development phase.
See PROGRESS.md for detailed updates.


CONCEPT

The idea behind this project is to mimic the phenomenon of synesthesia, which allows people to create visual representations
for sounds and music. 


LATEST RESULTS

Departing from my previous GAN template, I tried using k-means clustering and librosa feature extraction. The results are below.
