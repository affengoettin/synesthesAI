# synesthesAI

Currently in the development phase.
See PROGRESS.md for detailed updates.


***Concept***           
The idea behind this project is to mimic the phenomenon of synesthesia, which allows people to create visual representations
for sounds and music. 


***Latest Results***            
Departing from my previous GAN template, I tried using k-means clustering and librosa feature extraction. The latest results can be found at results/km_3inputfit.mp4.
